title: 'Feeling Stuck - 2'

This is a follow up to the previous note. I am also feeling kind of stuck because I 
honestly did not have enough room in my mind for everything with diablo 4 coming out
and me having to play it (because it's kind of fun). 

But there is something I need to do to limit the fun and avoid turning it into addiction.
Thinking about the loots in game and my build is not helping. I need to focus on my build path
and commit to it, it's the best way to avoid wasting time. I need to set my daily goals:

1. The character is getting stronger (farming loot, leveling up, game progression)
2. I have something to look forward to the next day/session (so that I don't keep opening up the game
to see what I need to do next like a headless fly)

So from now on, I will break my game
progression into the following phases:

1. farming renown, run through the map to hit all altars of lilith and get the paragon point bonuses.
2. farming gear/level until 70. Can do this by completing world events or side quests. Or just dungeons.
3. optimizing build: only do this when I cannot handle level-appropriate dungeons.

And as a "daemon" process, at the end of each session (1 hour mark) I would spend 5-10 minutes to organize
my loot or storage

I think this is a good way to work with playing the game with time restrictions.

## Back to topic - software development

What else am I feeling stuck about? I touched on project management tools like github projects,
and also learned terraform infra-as-code tool, which is pretty nice and works smoothly for now.
I need to gradually learn to integrate that into my own projects.

For my camera app though, I am still onboarded to using free platforms like github pages and aws websocket gateway
and dynamodb for hosting, but I do think it's good to think about future plans of transitioning
 to docker and kubernetes.
