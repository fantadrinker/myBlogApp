Today morning I went to apartment gym for a quick workout. 
I fell back to the old routine of a quick 30 min full body workout,
And I think if I keep up with it I can also achieve my goals of 
keeping fit and strength.
But I still wasted some time from 5:30 to 6:30. I got up, played
with misty and made breakfast.

Tomorrow though I will need to get stuff done quicker, because I 
need to get to work earlier (writing TDD, finishing up my task)

I have been thinking about 2 things. First, how do I allocate time
for my games? I think I need 2-3 hours to enjoy it, so maybe after work? I can spend 6-8 pm on it, or around 6-8 am. I think I will keep 6-8 am (morning time) for more organized studying time.
Second thing is the plan for my bean bag sofa. Right now it's slipping too much I feel like.
I will probably need a rag to keep it in place.
