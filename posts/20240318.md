How does my brain work? I think this question is what confused me
for the longest time. And it's the key to improving my life.

Because I feel like all the unhappiness is the result of my brain
fighting against itself. For example, I force myself to supress my 
negative feelings because they are not 'optimal' according to 
'social standards'. Instead, what I should've done is to process 
the feeling, and try to learn from it. I feared failure, and the
result I got is I don't even try anymore is another example.

How to know my brain better? I can take notes on what triggers my
emotion, try to replay some scenarios during the day or the past 
week, and think about my emotions, but I need to be careful 
not to think too much about it. 

Alright this is today, I'll try to be more consistent.
