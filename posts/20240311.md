Today I want to make some "reservations" for tomorrow's morning. Because I don't find my past week's morning very productive.

I will get up at 5:30, get dressed, brush teeth and then make breakfast at 5:45.

Finishing up breakfast, I will clean my dishes and make my bed at 6, should finish around 6:30.

Then I will do some exercises, finishing around 7:30, then play some video games until 8:30, when I will start working

### Update on Marth 13th (2 days later):

It's hard to get up at that time it turns out. I kept getting up at around 6:00 am. 

Maybe I should adjust it a little bit. 

| time | activity |
| --- | --- | 
| 6:00 | get up, brush teeth |
| 6:15 | make breakfast, make bed |
| 6:45 | finish breakfast, clean dishes |
| 7:00 | internet time, youtube |
| 7:15 | workout or reading or guitar, no screen time |
| 8:00 | prep for work |


This looks like a good morning routine.
