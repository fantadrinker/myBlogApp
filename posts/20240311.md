Today I want to make some "reservations" for tomorrow's morning. Because I don't find my past week's morning very productive.

I will get up at 5:30, get dressed, brush teeth and then make breakfast at 5:45.

Finishing up breakfast, I will clean my dishes and make my bed at 6, should finish around 6:30.

Then I will do some exercises, finishing around 7:30, then play some video games until 8:30, when I will start working
