Today we went to langley to view some new town houses for sale.

Both of them are about 10-to-20-minute drive from town center.

The most common floor plan has garage on the first floor, and living room on the second floor,
and then 3 bedrooms on the third. 

The garage usually has 2 car slots, I feel like 
I can make half of it the garage gym. 

The living room is huge, which I appreciate,
but not quite sure what to do with the space. Maybe I can have a VR space?

The third floor can have one of the bedroom as my home office/game room, and a room for meditation/yoga, and a third for main bedroom.

Overall I like it, but Cass disliked the lack of space in the main bedroom, and the location, and I also dislike the commute from there.
