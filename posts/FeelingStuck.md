title: 'Feeling Stuck - Vim'

Hmm, what happened in the past month?

I was aiming to get my remote camera launched but I got side-tracked by many things. I am now feeling kind of stuck and don't know if I am going the right path. Let me list out some of them.

### Learning NVim

I have been using VSCode for frontend development for most of my professional career. I wanted to try out vim, because of the productivity boost that can come from it, with the idea being not having to use mouse and keep my hand on the keyboard.

I followed a popular youtuber/streamer's setup guide to set up my vim configuration with lua from scratch, and it worked somewhat fine, I am still getting used to it. Sometimes I have to stop typing and try to translate what I usually would do with mouse with a keybind instead (e.g. scroll down a bunch of lines <-> ctrl+u). 

After trying it out for a while (3 weeks) I can see the value for developing a backend application on a smaller screen, for the following reasons:

- less ram usage: VSCode uses lot more ram than vim.
- less distraction from UI: I probably installed too much useless plugins/extensions on VSCode and have not been paying attention to them.
- for backend application where I can run test with simple command, I can really keep all of my 10 fingers on the keyboard without touching the touchpad.

But for frontend I will still need to frequently use mouse to switch between screens and test my webapp so it did not end up boosting my productivity a lot, if any. But it did get me on board with the vim extension on VSCode. I think it will be a good middle-ground for me to gradually adapt to the learning curve.
