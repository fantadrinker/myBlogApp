Missed daily blogs past couple of days, not acceptable.

But this weekend has been great! I played board games with friends 
again and like last time, I lost both of them. Feel like if I play
more I will get better at planning my rounds and understanding of
the games. I often think I do not understand the game well, and 
have hard time remembering different goals. Maybe I should play
more with Cass, but she doesn't seem to be interested in them.

What she is interested in is playing badminton. But the reservations
in bonsor run out pretty quickly so I need to figure out a way to 
get some consistent practice in. Maybe try to reserve at another gym?
Or just go to Richmond Clearone every week. Maybe even join a
badminton group.

I also am thinking of attending fitness classes in Bonsor. I can go
before work on some days, and maybe after work before dinner.

About learning, I will be pair-learning with Cass during her admission
prep and probably won't have much time after work. So I need to 
adjust my time to do more before work or after she goes to bed.
I'll see if I can hold on to my schedule of getting up later than 
she does.

But how do I feel about the weekend? Overall I think I accomplished 
something, but there are much more work to do. I hope I can keep on.
