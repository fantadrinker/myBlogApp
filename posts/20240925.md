Today was pretty good. Went to gym before work, and got some time after dinner to relax and do my own stuff.
Will have a good opportunity this Friday, I will need to get as much info as possible from this, and it might 
determine my future career.

I feel like I suck at public presentations, too many uhhs and ahhs and takes me a long time to get to the point.
It was so bad that I had to spend hours editing the recording to make it consumable. I honestly don't know how 
my teammates put up with it. I need to do a better job preparing for them and writing out the scripts and follow them.

For the following week? I really need to take more time thinking about the things I did well in, and those that I did not.
