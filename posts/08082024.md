There are soo many things to keep track of I feel like I'm falling apart.

Immigration is one, there are so many things that depend on it (mortgage, work, etc) and 
so little that I can do about it. I will need to keep following up with the corporate 
immigration lawyer for it.

Interviewing for new jobs is another. Technically this is not a priority, but there is 
fear in me that I might miss out on a good opportunity.

Wedding is next, I don't even have a good vow speech or any speech ready. I need to prepare for it.

And then work. There are so much things I can do but just don't have time for them right now.
Maybe I can keep up with doing bare minimum for now and wait for new manager to join.

And Moving, I need to book a van. booked, feel a little better.

Okay that's it for today.
