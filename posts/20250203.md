Lets start with something simple, recalling what happened after work today.

Cass and I went to Shabu Shabu tonight. Because it is her lunar birthday. We ordered 2 combos 
with base soup upgrade. The experience was good, the combo costed 35 dollars but it comes with 
dessert (ice cream) and drinks (milk tea). However the meat was mediocre so we decided that we 
won't go again.

I had an idea with learning guitar. I will try to download classical guitar tabs that are easy
to play, or beginner friendly.

I hope tomorrow I can keep it up.
