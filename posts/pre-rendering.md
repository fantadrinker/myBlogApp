## What I did today:

Unfortunately I couldn't make table formating working within this markdown file. So that's an excuse for me to 
not do this section at all.

## What I have been thinking for today

### Fitness

Today I'm setting my fitness goals by the end of 2021: 
- **dunk the basketball** at regular rim (outside park downstairs)
- able to do **muscle up**(s)

To achieve this I'm setting the following temporary goals that might help:

- **weight loss diet** with lean and healthy food sources: 1800 calories per day and active logging
- **follow through** with nike training's program (once every two days)
- gym weight lifting workouts on off days, **more core trainings**
- **weight my foods**


### Blogs

- Separate different types of blogs: health/fitness and technology/app learning
