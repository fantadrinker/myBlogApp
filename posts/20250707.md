Today is sunny day, way too sunny I would try to avoid walking outside. After work I played star wars game for a bit, the game has good realistic graphics and fun mechanics (parrying melee attacks, reflecting ranged shots etc.) I should play it next after zelda.

I then went to buy a used tennis racket from downtown. What a dumb decision. I only went because I asked the guy when I can pick up after work today. And felt guilty that if I don't go the person might cancelled something already.

We then went to grocery shopping. It was quick but still a bit exhausting.
