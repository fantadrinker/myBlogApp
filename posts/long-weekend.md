## Long weekend

Today is the last day of Canada day long weekend.

I hiked to the eagle bluffs from cypress mountain on Saturday, and paddle boarding from the north
shore of SFU on Sunday.

The hike was more tiring than I expected, might be because we took a new route that 
climbs to a peak to get to the bluff. The view was great, and here are the photos:

Then on Sunday we went to barnet marine park to paddleboard. The goal originally was to 
paddle to deep cove beach, but we got too tired at belcarra beach and decided to turn back

The wind also got heavier on the way back, and we noticed the paddleboard got deflated a little
so it was really rough paddling back.

## Plan for the week

By the time I got to this post is already next day morning, and it's time to plan what to do this
week. For this blog app, I don't really feel like migrating the posts to S3. Rather I want 
to set up a script to upload images to the s3 bucket.

The goals are:

1. speed up creation of multi-image posts.
2. explore possibilities of video posts.

To do 1, I need a process to upload images to s3.
