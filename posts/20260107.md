Today played pickup basketball. Had to end early because I my calf cramped during the last game.

I played pretty good offence individually, the team didn't have enough tactics/good screens to create opportunities.

Caught 2 lead passes but didn't make either layup (close though). On the second lead pass I did not have enough
single leg strength so I caught cramp. 

I also played bad defense and could not keep up with my assignment. Felt stiff. I really need to work on my mobility and
flexibility. And conditioning of course.
