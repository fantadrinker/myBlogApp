Today is the second day of work in 2024, and I have already failed my new year resolution target.
In my previous post I mentioned I am setting up a daily routine to follow every day so that I can 
make progress on each 2024 goals I set up for myself.

It all started last night, after I finished my first blog of the year, I went to bed but couldn't fall asleep.
And it turned out that I ate too much, that despite not getting enough sleep on the night before, I fell asleep
at around 11:30, which is about 1 hour late for my target bed time. If this continues happening I would need to 
extend my bed time from 8 hours to 8.5 or 9 hours. Then this morning when Cass got up for work at 5 I was awake,
which wasn't new, but I could not fall asleep after that. Weird. It's been harder and harder for me to fall asleep again after wake up it seems. Could it be something wrong with my health? Maybe it's the anxiety induced?

After I got up, I was pretty upset that I went straight for my gaming PC after breakfast, which lasted until 9 am, then I chose to work from home for the day, which turned out to be a good choice since there isn't any work 
for me today.

Speaking of idling at work, I was distracted a lot of times during work today, but I chose to browse the internet
instead of reading the books I set up on my desk. I should pay more attention to how to utilize fragmented time
at work!

Then comes dinner time. I was pretty quick to prepare the food, took 1 hour to cook rice, fried veggies and
made bagel sandwiches for us. I first heat up a pan with some butter in it, then sliced a bagel in half, put both inside-down on the pan to make the surface crusty, then cracked an egg in the remaining space to fry on.
Then I cut the tomato slices and pulled out some lettuce leaves for veggies. Then assembled them together when
the bagels are ready, along with some cheese. Used a wax sheet to wrap them up then they're good to go!

I then got some free time from about 6:40 to 8 for some finance app coding, then I went for this blog.

I might get some more time after this before bed, but I feel like going to bed early today. Probably will at 9:30, which leave me until then to read some books, wind down or even play some games!

So to summarize the things I did well on today:

1. lucky to have no work so I can get to work late and get off work early

Yeah that's it. Things I need to improve:

1. Morning was wasted!
2. Find better things to do when slacking off at work.
3. Sleep schedule is fucked.
